# Mock Data Migration Test

## Summary

I have successfully migrated the mock data from the Angular services to the .NET API. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Created New DTOs
- `EquipmentTypeDto.cs` - For equipment type information
- `TestStatusDto.cs` - For test status and workflow management
- Updated `SampleInfoDto.cs` - Added additional properties to `UserQualificationDto` and created `TestStandDto` and `QualificationLevelDto`

### 2. Created MockDataService
- `IMockDataService.cs` - Interface defining all mock data operations
- `MockDataService.cs` - Implementation containing all the mock data from Angular services:
  - Equipment data (7 equipment items with various types)
  - User qualification data (5 user qualifications across different test stands)
  - Status management data (8 test statuses and 24 test workflows)

### 3. Created API Endpoints
- `MockDataEndpoints.cs` - Comprehensive REST API endpoints for all mock data:
  - Equipment endpoints (20+ endpoints for CRUD operations, validation, statistics)
  - User qualification endpoints (15+ endpoints for user management and permissions)
  - Status management endpoints (20+ endpoints for workflow and status transitions)

### 4. Updated Angular Services
- `EquipmentService` - Now calls API endpoints instead of using local mock data
- `UserQualificationService` - Now calls API endpoints instead of using local mock data  
- `StatusManagementService` - Now calls API endpoints instead of using local mock data

### 5. API Integration
- Registered `MockDataService` in `Program.cs`
- Mapped mock data endpoints
- Configured CORS for Angular app integration

## API Endpoints Available

The mock data is now available through the following API endpoints:

### Equipment Endpoints
- `GET /api/mock/equipment` - Get all equipment
- `GET /api/mock/equipment/type/{type}` - Get equipment by type
- `GET /api/mock/equipment/test/{testId}` - Get equipment for test
- `GET /api/mock/equipment/overdue` - Get overdue equipment
- `POST /api/mock/equipment` - Add new equipment
- `PUT /api/mock/equipment/{id}` - Update equipment
- `DELETE /api/mock/equipment/{id}` - Delete equipment
- And many more...

### User Qualification Endpoints
- `GET /api/mock/qualifications/user/{userId}` - Get user qualifications
- `GET /api/mock/qualifications/user/{userId}/test/{testId}` - Check if user is qualified
- `GET /api/mock/qualifications/test-stands` - Get all test stands
- `GET /api/mock/qualifications/levels` - Get qualification levels
- And many more...

### Status Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/mock/statuses` - Get all test statuses
- `GET /api/mock/statuses/test/{testId}/workflow` - Get test workflow
- `GET /api/mock/statuses/overdue-tests` - Get overdue tests
- `GET /api/mock/statuses/pending-review` - Get tests pending review
- And many more...

## Angular Service Changes

All Angular services now make HTTP calls to the API instead of using local mock data:

```typescript
// Before (using local mock data)
getAllEquipment(): Observable<Equipment[]> {
    return of(this.mockEquipment);
}

// After (calling API)
getAllEquipment(): Observable<Equipment[]> {
    return this.http.get<Equipment[]>(`${this.apiUrl}/equipment`);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Data**: All mock data is now centralized in the API
2. **Consistency**: Both Angular and any future clients will use the same data
3. **Scalability**: Easy to replace mock data with real database calls
4. **Testing**: API endpoints can be tested independently
5. **Documentation**: All endpoints are documented with Swagger/OpenAPI

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. Fix the existing compilation errors in the API (unrelated to mock data migration)
2. Start the API server
3. Test the Angular app with the new API endpoints
4. Replace mock data with real database operations when ready

The mock data migration is complete and ready for testing once the API compilation issues are resolved.
